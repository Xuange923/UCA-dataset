<br><br>

We have developed UCA (UCF-Crime Anotation dataset) based on the UCF-Crime dataset, which is a real-world surveillance video dataset consisting of 13 real-world anomalies. From the UCF-Crime dataset, we finally collect **1,854 videos** after excluding some low-quality ones from the original set of 1,900 videos.UCA contains **20,822** event descriptions, each providing the precise start and end times of the events at a granularity of 0.1 seconds. The duration of most events ranges from **10 to 50 seconds**, with an average of **23 words** per sentence. 

Notably, the unique characteristics of UCA-dataset are that extensive annotation duration,high annotation density, and rich annotation information. As the first multi-modal surveillance video dataset, UCA serves as a valuable resource for advancing multi-modal learning techniques in the field of intelligent security.
